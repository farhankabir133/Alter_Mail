## 💡 Our Story

Founded in **2025**, AltMail began as a small side project to stop spam from taking over our inboxes.

That frustration turned into a passion for **digital privacy**.  
Now, AltMail serves **thousands of users worldwide**, offering reliable anonymous communication without compromise.
